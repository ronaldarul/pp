March 21:

downloaded tomcat from http://www.updatestar.com/directdownload/apache-tomcat-remove-only/2103322
installed with shut down port 8005 
http 1.1 port 8080
ajp 1.3 connector port 8009
windows service name Tomcat7
admin login : ronaldarul/ronjan82
destination folder C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 7.0
java jre used is : C:\Program Files\Java\jre7

March 22 :
In windows 7 when i searched for tomcat i got Monitor Tomcat tool and clicked on it it had options to start and stop server...also noticed a tray in windows tray ...
so just verify if it is up and running and now after starting it...(mine is a windows serviec so the server is started when i reboot the machine..)
So simply if you type the url http://localhost:8080 it will bring tomcat home page which is basically some files in docs folder...
To deploy new application all you have to do is just drop your war file or exploded format files into webapps

I just copied an existing directory from examples and named that as ronexamples so what happens is the directory name becomnes the context path..
so when i say http://localhost:8080/ronexamples/ the defailt page showed up as well..

Now you have a full fledged web app deployed in your own context..go ahead and change a servlet and do whatever you want...

Well we need to configure a database..go for mysql...search google for MySQL on Windows (Installer & Tools)  where installer is available instead of just downloading zip file...
after downloading mysql installer..click on it ...i chose developer installation...(installs all ..server, notifier, docs, and examples )
While installing ..chose the default config type "Development Machine" and tcp/ip port 3307
Root password ronjan82
and added a user with following username/password 
ronaldarul/ronjan82

WIndows service name : MySQL56  (noting down with case sensitivity..just to be sure..) 

after you are done you will see My Sql 5.6 Command Line Client on your star menu..(you also have mysql workbench installed..you may have some gui client like oralce sql developer..it is but i do not know where and how to use it..)you can enter password you set up while installing.... (the user you set up whil installing ) 

>create database rondb
now use it ...
>use rondb
now create tables..
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOOOOOO.....
 create table rondb.rontesttable (username varchar(10));
IT was executed successfdully....Awesome...

mysql> insert into rontesttable values('ron');
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.06 sec)

Now trying to configure by looking at the doc at http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/jndi-datasource-examples-howto.html
Added this to context.xml
<Resource name="jdbc/ronsqldb" auth="Container" type="javax.sql.DataSource"
               maxActive="100" maxIdle="30" maxWait="10000"
               username="ronaldarul" password="ronjan82" driverClassName="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"
               url="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/rondb"/>
          
          Our port was 3037 need to check..??
     context.xml was not able to be updated....finally gave permission to myself by giving full permission to ROn HP users..also stopped the service via windows task manager so that I could edit that file..
 Added the following in web.xml..(note they have given a complete web.xml the beinging is different..but let us give it a try by just adding this one...
 
   <resource-ref>
       <description>DB Connection</description>
       <res-ref-name>jdbc/ronsqldb</res-ref-name>
       <res-type>javax.sql.DataSource</res-type>
       <res-auth>Container</res-auth>
   </resource-ref>

   
 ONe thing you should notice is there is only one context.xml and only one web.xml for all webapplications under webapps...

Also copied the following jsp 

	
	
<%@ taglib uri="http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/sql" prefix="sql" %>
<%@ taglib uri="http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/core" prefix="c" %>
<sql:query var="rs" dataSource="jdbc/ronsqldb">
select username from rontesttable
</sql:query>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>DB Test</title>  </head>  <body>  <h2>Results</h2>
<c:forEach var="row" items="${rs.rows}">    Foo ${row.username}<br/>    
</c:forEach>
  </body>
</html>

kept this jsp as testdb.jsp under stlouis app(that is under stlouis directory under jsp directory)

This jsp uses some taglibs whicha are available at jstl.jar and standard.jar these jars were already available under the examples directory so since we copied one ofthe 
examples folder and renamed it as stlouis those jars were available for us too...

http://localhost:8080/stlouis/jsp/testdb.jsp

When accesing this , i got the driver not found to connect to the databse...

Downloaded mysql connector J and there was a jar file ...copied it to stlouis/web-inf/lib folder...

tried again but did not work...need to check if the driver class specified in the context.xml indeed is available in that jar ...
to see the jar..downloaded winzip...will continue next time... 

March 25 :
---------

When i tried to access i did not see the class not found issue...could be the restart helped the class not found issue...
now i saw access denied for user ronaldarul (using password : YES)
Created user by first issuing the command use rondb and then executing the following command..
mysql> create user 'ronaldarul'@'localhost' identified by 'ronjan82'
    -> ;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> grant all privileges on rondb.rontestable to 'ronaldarul'@'localhost'
    -> ;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> commit;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'ronaldarul'@'%'
    -> ;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> commit;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)


May be we need to bounce ...

After 4 hrs of fight, here is the jsp that would set datasource...Store it under stlouis/jsp and delete the one under catalina/work/../../  It is better to save with new name everytime...
use this link to access http://127.0.0.1:8080/stlouis/jsp/testds11.jsp

<%@ taglib uri="http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/core" prefix="c" %>
<%@ taglib uri="http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/sql" prefix="sql"%>
<html>
<head>
<title>JSTL sql:setDataSource Tag</title>
</head>
<body>
 
<sql:setDataSource var="snapshot" driver="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"
     url="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3307/mysql"
     user="javauser"  password="javadude"/>

<sql:query dataSource="${snapshot}" sql="select user from user" var="rs" />

<c:forEach var="row" items="${rs.rows}">
    user: ${row.user}<br/>    
</c:forEach>
 
</body>
</html>

THe issue was i had a wrong port number 3306 instead of 3307..

Now having pulled some data from mysql database to the browser...you can configure a bit more ..to use a connection or whatsoever...

Next class would be to set up some tables and configure hibernate...


March 26:

Trying to bring up tomcat using command prompt..so that you can bring up and down..

Go to 
C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 7.0>
set Path=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_02\bin
set CLASSPATH=%CLASSPATH%;C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 7.0\bin;C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 7.0\bin\bootstrap.jar;C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 7.0\bin\tomcat-juli.jar
java org.apache.catalina.startup.Bootstrap

Getting the following error..(before you got some bind error..make sure you have the tom server shut down ...)


April 2:

There was some error because the logs directory did not have enough rights...windows 7 stupid security system did not show me wheter the read only attribute was removed or not..it kept showing read only ...anyway after a long time i started the server ..it was fine..just set the classpath and path as said above and use java ..bootstrap..same as above..
Accessed this page  http://127.0.0.1:8080/stlouis/jsp/testds11.jsp and it was okay..
Now closed the tomcat command prompt and tried to access the page ..it did notwork..
so started tomcat again and now it worked..OHooooooooooooooooooooooo tomcat start up and shut down via the command prompt is successful...

Next try to put those commands in a ms dos file and keep a short cut key for the cmd file...and also try spring first ....

April 8


we havd downloaded all spring jar files and they are under C:\Users\Dalton\mywebsite\spring_downloaded

Added a servlet to web.xml (the only one web.xml under webapps directory and wrote teh servlet the source file is under c:\users\dalton\src\ron\raj\servlets\RonServlet.java..

trying to compile the class but it is failing to get javax.xx stuff..
add servlet-api.jar from tomcat7.0 folder  and then go to src folder and try javac.. also fist step you should have added the path and classpath as above..

set CLASSPATH=%CLASSPATH%;C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 7.0\lib\servlet-api.jar

now servlet compiled ..now copy the classes under src folder to classes folder..

add classes to the classpath of your server start up cmd..

set CLASSPATH=%CLASSPATH%;C:\Users\Dalton\mywebsite\classes (see the final one below..)

Finally here is the classpath
Go to 
cd C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 7.0
set CLASSPATH=%CLASSPATH%;C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 7.0\bin;C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 7.0\bin\bootstrap.jar;C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 7.0\bin\tomcat-juli.jar;C:\Program Files\Java\jre7\lib\rt.jar;C:\Users\Dalton\mywebsite\classes
java org.apache.catalina.startup.Bootstrap

the serlvet registration load on start up had some issues removed it..

when you try to access now using  good news it tries to load the servlet but fails with class not found 
java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: javax/servlet/http/HttpServlet

Try adding servlet-api.jar to your server cmd window..



April 21 : Git hub
------------------
after installing github i noticed the following directory c:\users\Dalton\doucments\github (if you go to this directory directly using cmd prompt nothing will work..look for Git Shell and click on it then it will bring up thisdirector in cmd prompt...

Now in a command prompt i created a directory myrepo and then as per instruction created a file by saying touch ..created ronsreadme file..

Looks like i added all files from myrepo directory to pp.git in github..

Now i logged into github account (ronaldarul/ronjan8213) and verified the content of ronsreadme
Also created a file tomcat_start in your local ..it is a command prompt file ..note at the end you have cmd /k so that it will not close automatically..
now you set the path and classpath and add command to bring up tomcat server and add this file to git..


April 24
--------

I could not add a file under c:\temp it looks like we need to keep files under c:\users\Dalton\documents\GitHub\myrepo which is a git repository...

Having said that now let us try maven...before setting up the command prompt to bring up server..

ok downloaded maven and unziped it. Had issues while unzipping using winzip 9 ...used tools->'unzip and try' icon on win zip 9 and it unzipped.
the unzipped files/folders are under C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation


set M2_Home env variable as specified in the installation instruction.. M2_Home C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\apache-maven-3.2.1

set M2 environment variable in the user variables with the value %M2_HOME%\bin




tips : WinKey + Pause key will bring your environment variables system properties.
       WinKey + R will run the small window where you can type in cmd to bring command prompt.

followed the instruction and verified maven was set up correctly.
note path had to be set as a user variable...not as a system variable...
